2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

RTRES-2#1 Warning
BounceAcross resources  
1 GLOBAL_CLOCK net(s) have at least one node with COST_CODE_NAME equal to BOUNCEACROSS (COST_CODE 12). This situation occurs when a global clock net must enter a clock region where all global clock routing resources are occupied. Check the report from report_clock_utilization to determine which clock regions are traversed by the problem net and use floorplanning or other physical constraints to ensure a maximum of 12 global clock nets occupy each clock region. The problem net(s) are ALU_result_To_Rt0_BUFG.
